The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (ID) estimator is an alternative formulation of the Incidence Decay (ID) model which includes a decay factor to reflect the often observed outbreak decline.
This addresses the potential underestimation of the $R_0$ estimate when using the ID method.
The method of least squares is used to estimate $R_0$, and similar to the ID model, the serial interval is assumed to be known and this method is developed assuming the SIR model.
We note that, since we need to obtain a minimizer of the decay factor to solve the optimization problem, we require that the number of cases in the dataset be at least 2.

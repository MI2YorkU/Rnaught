The incidence decay (ID) estimator assumes an exponential model and finds the parameters by minimizing the sum of the
squared differences between the observed cases counts and the case counts expected based on the assumed model.
The method assumes that the serial interval is known. This means that the user needs to input the value of the serial
interval. The serial interval is the average time between the first infection and the time the first infected individual
exhibits disease symptoms.

  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_interval" target="_blank">serial interval (SI)</a> is a parameter
  required by most of the estimators, and can also be estimated by some of them (if not specified). For the latter, "â€”"
  is reported in the "Serial interval" column of the estimates table, and the estimated value is shown next to the
  <em>R</em><sub>0</sub> result(s) as "(SI = ...)".

  The SI is defined as the average time between successive infections in a chain of transmission (i.e., the time between
  the infection of an infected individual and their subsequent transmissions).

#' Case Counts Validation
#'
#' This is an internal function called by the estimators. It validates the
#' supplied case counts by ensuring it is a vector of integers of length at
#' least `min_length` with entries greater than or equal to `min_count`.
#' Execution is halted if these requirements are not satisfied.
#'
#' @param cases The case counts to be validated.
#' @param min_length The minimum length of the vector of case counts.
#' @param min_count The minimum value of the case count vector's entries.
#'
#' @noRd

#' Real Number Testing

#' Integer Testing
#'
#' This is an internal function which checks whether the given argument is an
